 * @title Voting Math Library

 * @notice Provides functionality to calculate voting power based on the amount of tokens locked and the remaining
 * vesting duration. This model aligns voting power with vested interest, factoring in both the quantity of tokens and
 * the commitment length.
 *
 * @dev The library calculates voting power as a function of the locked token amount and the proportion of the remaining
 * vesting duration to the maximum vesting duration. This calculation is intended to be used in governance systems where
 * longer commitments carry more weight.
 *
 * Constants:
 * - `MAX_VESTING_DURATION`: Represents the maximum duration for vesting, set to 2 years (104 weeks).
