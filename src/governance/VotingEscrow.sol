/**
 * @title Voting Escrow Contract
 * @author SeaZarrgh
 * @notice VotingEscrow is a UUPS-upgradeable contract that manages locked tokens for governance purposes. It extends
 * ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable to represent locked tokens as NFTs, allowing for tokenized governance rights. The
 * contract allows users to lock tokens in exchange for voting power, represented by an NFT. The voting power decreases
 * over time as the lock approaches its expiry, encouraging continuous participation.
 *
 * @dev The contract leverages various OpenZeppelin libraries and contracts for upgradeability, ownership, and token
 * handling.
 *
 *      Key features include:
 *      - Token locking mechanism with adjustable vesting duration within set bounds.
 *      - ERC721 token representation of locked tokens, facilitating transfer and management of voting rights.
 *      - Integration with a custom art proxy for dynamic NFT representation.
 *      - Voting power calculation based on locked amount and vesting duration.
 *      - Custom error handling for various failure scenarios.
 *      - Functions for minting, burning, splitting, and merging of voting escrow tokens.
 *
 * The contract employs a unique storage pattern for upgrade safety and uses Checkpoints for efficient voting power
 * tracking. It is designed with modularity, security, and gas efficiency in mind.
