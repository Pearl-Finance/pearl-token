/**
 * @title Pearl Migrator
 * @author SeaZarrgh
 * @notice PearlMigrator is responsible for migrating tokens from a legacy Pearl contract to a new Pearl contract
 * across LayerZero. It facilitates the transition of token holdings in a cross-chain environment.
 *
 * @dev The contract extends NonblockingLzAppUpgradeable and UUPSUpgradeable, incorporating functionalities for
 * token migration and contract upgradeability. Key features include burning tokens from the legacy contract, sending
 * cross-chain messages to credit tokens in the new contract, and fee estimation for migrations.
 *
 * Functions:
 * - Migrate tokens by burning them in the legacy contract and initiating a cross-chain message to the new contract.
 * - Estimate fees for token migration across chains.
 * - Handle upgrade authorization as part of the UUPS upgradeability pattern.
 *
 * The contract uses LayerZero for cross-chain communication, ensuring reliable and secure migration of token holdings.
